#### Install this project on PyCharm

![Git Download](https://i.ibb.co/DVQXBkq/first.jpg)


2) Unzip and open the project in PyCharm. PyCharm should prompt you to create a new virtual environment and install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt. Agree and click OK.

This should do the trick. However, if you still see any red underlines in your main.py then tell PyCharm to check the virtual environment and dependencies again by going to File -> Reload All from Disk.
